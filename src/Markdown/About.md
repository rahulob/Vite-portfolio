# About Me

Hi, I'm Rahul Gupta - a software engineer and maker of things based in Bengaluru, India.

I'm passionate about technology, personal growth, and fatherhood. I love building things that make a difference and sharing my journey through writing and photography.

When I'm not coding or taking photos, you'll find me exploring new technologies, reading books on personal development, or spending quality time with my family.

## What I Do

- **Software Engineering**: Building scalable applications and solving complex problems
- **Photography**: Capturing moments and telling stories through images
- **Writing**: Sharing insights about tech, personal growth, and fatherhood
- **Making**: Creating tools and applications that help people

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to collaborate, discuss ideas, or just say hello!
